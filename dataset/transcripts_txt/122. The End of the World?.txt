December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #1: Planet X collides with our planet.
One of the biggest December 21, 2012 end of the world theories states that on that fateful winter solstice our planet earth will collide with the mysterious and fabled Planet X from the 1980s. Conspiracy theorists believe that world governments have been hiding the existence of Planet X since they discovered it was on a collision course with us many years ago.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #2: Shift in Earth’s Magnetic Poles
Many people believe the December 21, 2012 end of the world theory that earth will be devastated by a dramatic shift in the earth’s magnetic poles. Scientists say that this pole shift has happened with regularity throughout earth’s history, but that we are not due for another shift for some time. That does not keep people from buying into the shifty possibilities of a 2012 end of the world.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #3: Sun Supernova
One popular December 21, 2012 end of the world theory involves the death of our sun. This theory says that our earth will be burned up when our sun goes supernova right before Christmastime, 2012. This cataclysmic supernova would consume our solar system and wipe our world out from the Milky Way galaxy.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #4: Disruption of Gravity by Planet X
Another of Planet X theories, this 2012 end of the world theory says that Planet X will not collide with us, but rather it will pass so closely to our earth that it will disrupt our gravity and cause massive global disasters.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #5: Alignment With the Center of Our Galaxy
A major source of December 21, 2012 end of the world theories is the fact that on that date our earth and sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy, an event that only happens every 26,000 years. Some believe that this celestial event will in some way rip our earth apart, leaving no life for the planet.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #6: Global Warming and Floods
With the global warming scares of the past decade, one of the December 21, 2012 end of the world theories involves the atmosphere of our earth degrading to the point that global warming reaches new highs. The resulting temperature change would cause a snowballing polar ice cap melt that would flood the oceans, wiping out our land masses and killing marine life with a massive infusion of fresh water into the oceans.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #7: Seismic Disturbance
This earth-shattering 2012 end of the world theory says that our world will be torn apart by an incredible seismic event. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions will shake the ground, level cities, and wipe out civilization as we know it.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #8: Shift in the Collective Consciousness of Humanity
By far one of the most creative December 21, 2012 end of the world theories, this theory claims that the human race has been on the verge of a shift in the collective consciousness of humanity. What this means no one can say, but followers of this theory believe that the end of the world will come with a dramatic change in the way the human mind works and that they will bring about the end of the world.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #9: World War 3 and Nuclear Holocaust
One 2012 end of the world theory involves nuclear holocaust and the beginning of World War 3. Due to global nuclear capabilities, the nations of the world could wipe each other off the face of the earth in a matter of hours.
December 21, 2012 end of the world theory #10: Theorists Are Proven Wrong
One theorist believes that the end of the world will come when all of the people who have put their stock in calendars made 3000 years ago learn that they are wrong. For many who have lived, eaten, slept, and breathed 2012, discovering that the world did not end on December 21, 2012 will lead them to find that their world is, in fact, over.
