Here’s my conversation with the overall YEP competition winner, Edgar Hernandez from Mexico (aka Bono Chimp). [Download]

Again, apologies for the slight technical issue in this recording – there’a a bit of a delay which makes it sound like I’m interrupting Edgar. I assure you, it’s a technical fault due to recording via Skype – I’m not really that rude or impatient!
I hope you enjoy the conversation. Now it’s back to business as usual for LEP.
