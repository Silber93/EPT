In this episode I ask Paul, Alex and Moz some very stupid questions, with some revealing results.
Listen to the previous two episodes to find out more about The Brighton Fringe and my comedy counterparts.
Please leave your comments and questions below. I am always glad to hear from you.
All the best, have a good weekend and speak to you again soon.
