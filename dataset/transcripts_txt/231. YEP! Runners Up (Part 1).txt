Here are my conversations with runners up from the YEP competition. In this episode you’ll hear me talk to Kevser from Turkey, Max from Italy and Giovanni from Italy – all of whom won their groups in the competition. In the next episode you’ll hear from the other runners up, Yannick, Aritz, Phil and Javier, and then finally a longer conversation with the main winner Edgar from Mexico. Enjoy! [Download]

p.s. I’m a little bit frustrated by a technical issue in some of these interviews. There’s a slight delay on some of the Skype recordings – my interviewees responses are a bit late, and my responses come too quickly. It sounds like I’m rudely interrupting my interviewees sometimes. I hope it doesn’t bother you too much, or make me sound too rude!
