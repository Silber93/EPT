Hello Dear Listeners, I’ve been a little bit quiet recently but I’m still here.

Right-click here to download this episode.
This episode is a chance to explain what’s been going on recently, and to answer some of your questions and comments from Facebook and Twitter. Apologies for the slightly poor sound quality on this one.
Yesterday I devoted over an hour to recording an episode only to be let down by my recording device which ran out of memory space. It was very annoying indeed because I lost all the work that I had done on that recording. I’ve since learned the importance of regularly backing up your work on an external memory card or alternatively “backing up into the cloud”.
I hope you enjoy the episode and more episodes will follow before long, including the continuation of my series on The A – Z of British Slang.
Cheers,
Luke
p.s. Here are videos of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, and Queen performing at Live Aid in 1985. Enjoy!
