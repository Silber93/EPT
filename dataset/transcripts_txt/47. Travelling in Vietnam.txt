An interview with me about my holiday in Vietnam.
I recently bought an English speaking robot from Japan. His name is English Robot 3000, and he’s very nice. In this podcast, English Robot 3000 asks me questions about my holiday in Vietnam and I talk about what I did, where I went and how it felt.
The next podcast will contain lots of really useful language for meeting people when you are travelling.
Hope you enjoy the episode, and happy new year!
