Hi podcast people,
I was recently invited to appear on another podcast for learners of English, called English Across The Pond presented by Dan (UK) and Jennifer (USA).
You can listen to the episode below and check out their website at www.englishacrossthepond.com

Dan and Jen produce quite a lot of extra material to help you learn English from their episodes. Check out this link where you can get a vocabulary list, comprehension questions or just download the full episode guide from their website.
Dan and Jen are really friendly and both have lots of English teaching experience. You might enjoy listening to their podcast too.
Cheers!
Luke
