I’m joined by Alex, Paul and Moz as we have a few drinks and talk general nonsense. Enjoy!

In this episode you’ll hear:
-An introduction (10-12 mins) in which I give you a general update and explain what you’ll hear in the rest of the episode.
-The results of a Friday night recording in my flat with Alex, Paul and Moz. We had a few drinks while recording this episode so you might hear us slurring our words and generally getting a little bit pissed* so I hope you don’t mind that! In fact, according to all your comments on the last episode, you’d love to hear a slightly drunk conversation between 4 Londoners. However, if you’re expecting to hear 4 completely smashed football hooligans chanting the national anthem, I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed as we are all quite civilised drinkers these days.
*rude word! (as you may already know, it means ‘drunk’)
So that’s it for now. Please leave your comments, thoughts, jokes and suggestions below.
Have a great morning/afternoon/evening/night and if you listen to the podcast while driving or operating heavy machinery please take care!
