Introduction
Everyone knows it’s vital to review vocabulary you have learned. If you don’t review it then you’re likely to forget it! So, in this episode I will help you to remember some of the expressions I taught you in the early days of Luke’s English Podcast.
Of course, we will be doing this in a natrual way by demonstrating the way these expressions can be used in a natural, authentic and unscripted conversation. All you have to do is notice the expressions, remember them and then try and pick them up yourself.
Here’s what’s going to happen in the episode.
First, I will read out a list of 56 expression from episodes 1-11 and give you brief definitions of them. You can see the list of those expressions and their definitions below. Yes, I am a kind, generous and generally wonderful human for doing that!
Second, you should listen to the conversation between Kate and me and try to either notice the expressions as they are used (listen for the grammar of the expression, how it is pronounced etc) or predict which expression is coming next. You can do this while looking at the expression list below, or by simply listening without the list.
Third, you should look at the list again and practise using the expressions yourself. Perhaps you can just say some sentences about yourself or people you know. You should speak them rather than write them. You could record yourself speaking them and listen back to the recordings to give yourself some perspective on your pronunciation.
All of these things are good ways to improve your English with this podcast. Of course, if you prefer you can just sit back and enjoy listening to the podcast. As ever, please add your comments below. You can say whatever you like. Why don’t you write a sentence about yourself using one of the expressions from this episode?
Thanks again for listening to Luke’s English Podcast.
