The competition is now closed. Voting ends on 16 May 2012.
Thank you very much for your entries. I am now processing them and I will upload them in a podcast (or two) in the very near future, and you will be able to listen to all the comments people have sent me. Then you can vote on which one is your favourite.
Other news, I am back from my skiing holiday and I had a great time. I did fall over a lot, but I didnâ€™t injure my mouth so I can still speak!
Expect more podcast episodes to be uploaded soon.
Luke
