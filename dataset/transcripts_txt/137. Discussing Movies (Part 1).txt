A cup of tea and a chat about movies!

Right-click here to download this episode.
Henry Dean joins me for a cup of tea and a chat about movies. Part 2 will be available in the next few days.
In this episode, I talk to Henry about his background, his university course, his writing work and his interest in film and movies in general. We also explain and discuss various items of vocabulary related to film. We’ll teach you various words and phrases that you can use to talk about films with your friends. We also begin to answer questions which were sent in to us via Facebook. We continue to answer the questions in part 2, which will be available soon!
Click here to get Henry’s book “Stories from Paris” at Amazon.co.uk.
I know that a transcript of this episode would be useful. Unfortunately, a transcript of this episode is not available at the moment, but if you would like a challenge why not transcribe the episode yourself and send it to me? Then, eventually, I will be able to check/edit the transcript you have written and provide it for everyone. So, no transcript yet, but maybe in the future if I get help from a listener…
Thanks for listening. Your comments are welcome. I love talking about films, so there will be more film-related episodes in the future.
All the best, Luke
