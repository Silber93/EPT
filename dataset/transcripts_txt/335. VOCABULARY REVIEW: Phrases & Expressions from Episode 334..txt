This episode is a chance to review and explain some of the vocabulary that you heard in my interview with Craig Wealand. You’ll find the list of words I’m explaining in this episode printed below. You could copy+paste them into your own vocabulary lists, flashcard apps or simply write them into your vocabulary notebook. Remember, you should do some work to remember these phrases. Don’t just read them one by one, but try to create your own sentences with them, make associations with your life, create vivid images in your head or draw them on paper – basically, do whatever you can to push the phrases into your mind and back out through your mouth. You’re much more likely to remember them that way.

After listening to this you could go back to episode 334 and listen to it again and try to notice the phrases as they crop up naturally in conversation. There are lots of ways to remember words.
Don’t forget that you should also use phrases, because “if you don’t use it you lose it”. You can practise your speaking with native speakers on italki. Click here to check it out: teacherluke.co.uk/talk

Thanks for listening. Why don’t you add a comment in order to practise using some of the phrases in the list?
