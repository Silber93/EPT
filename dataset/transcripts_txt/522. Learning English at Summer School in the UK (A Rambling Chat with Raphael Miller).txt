Talking to my ex-colleague Raphael Miller about his new summer school for teenagers as well as many other topics, including British social and communication culture, growing up in Liverpool, studying at Oxford University, the famous Star Wars actor Raphael knows and remembering some of the old-fashioned ways we used to describe computers and the internet.

In this episode you can listen to a conversation I had with my friend Raphael Miller. Raph and I used to work together as teachers at the London School of English, along with Andy Johnson, Ben Butler and Carrick Cameron ‚Äì all of whom have featured in episodes of this podcast.
Since those days, Raph has done lots of work at summer schools in the UK and has recently set up his own summer school project called Your English Summer. This is a school for teenagers from around the world who want to come to the UK to develop their English skills while having a really cool experience living away from home for a couple of weeks.
I thought I would ask Raph about his project, about the benefits of sending your teenagers to the UK for a summer school English experience and also about Raph‚Äôs own experiences of learning languages as a teenager and into adulthood.
I hadn‚Äôt spoken to Raph for a while ‚Äì not since the last time he was on this podcast perhaps, and so it was really fun to catch up with him, find out about his project and also just ramble on about all kinds of other things, like his experiences at Oxford University, his childhood in Liverpool and a famous actor that he knows from university, who has had a big role in a Star Wars film. To find out all about that, just keep listening.
This might be a difficult conversation for you to follow, depending on your level. Reasons why it might be hard are:
But the point here is that this is an authentic chat which ultimately is good practice for you.
If you are a parent of teenage kids and you‚Äôre thinking about sending them to a summer school in the UK to learn English, you should check out Raphael‚Äôs school, which is called Your English Summer ‚Äì more details at yourEnglishsummer.co.uk
Now, let‚Äôs get stuck into the conversation.
Just before I hit the record button, Raph and I had been struggling to get connected on Skype. It wasn‚Äôt working properly on his computer, but to solve the problem he just turned it off and turned it back on again, which fixed it, of course ‚Äì because that‚Äôs usually how you fix technical problems. What do you do when something doesn‚Äôt work? How do you fix it? Well, have you tried turning it on and turning it off again? There are other generic solutions to typical technical problems of course‚Ä¶ can you think of any?
After that we talk a little bit about a recent episode of LEP that Raphael had been listening to ‚Äì a recent one with Amber & Sarah called ‚ÄúBecoming Maman‚Äù‚Ä¶ and the conversation just keeps on flowing from there, taking in some details about the social rules related to talking to new parents about their children (in fact, like me, Raph is also a new father ‚Äì his son is just 6 months old now) British social etiquette in general, how we both know each other and how we first met, and then onto the details Raphael‚Äôs project, learning English at summer schools in the UK, Liverpool, Oxford University and various other things‚Ä¶
So, now that you‚Äôre ready, let‚Äôs dive into this chat with Raphael Miller ‚Ä¶ and here we go.
160. The A to Z of Christmas
469. British Comedy: John Bishop
470. Understanding the Liverpool Accent
That was a rambling chat with Raphael Miller.

A note about LEP Premium
I‚Äôve been mentioning this for a couple of weeks now. I expect it to arrive in May. Things slowed down a bit this week because I got really ill with a very nasty throat infection ‚Äì tonsillitis to be exact. Tonsils are glands at the back of the throat. Mine got infected and all swollen, which was intensely painful for about 5 days. My whole head felt like it was going to explode, I felt like someone was stabbing me in the head and neck with needles, while also periodically stepping on my legs and back in a pair of Dr Marten‚Äôs boots. Swallowing was like torture. Not nice at all. It was a lot like when I was sick in Japan. Thankfully this time it was just the tonsilitis and not something more serious. Anyway, the French healthcare system and my wife, looked after me and I‚Äôm feeling a lot better. Also, for a week to 10 days this month we‚Äôre going to the UK on holiday, which means taking some more time out from podcasting duties. There should be another episode coming out while I‚Äôm away but the launch of LEP Premium is unlikely to happen until May. I‚Äôm also still working with Libsyn to actually do things like make additions to the app and some other things before LEPP can happen.
Anyway, it should come along in May and when it does you should find that one of the first Premium episodes is a language review of this episode, also there are some language features from the episode about pets I wanted to look at, so that‚Äôll probably come up too.
Remember that one of the aims of LEP Premium is to make sure you really learn the English you‚Äôve heard on the podcast ‚Äì not just hear it but really learn it properly ‚Äì the English you might not have even noticed but with which you need a guiding hand ‚Äì in this case my guiding hand, with all those years of teaching experience, podcast experience ‚Äì so I can help you with your English and have some fun while doing it. 
So, a language review for this episode with LEP Premium coming up.
Remember too that LEP Premium will work like this:
Coming soon in LEPland.
Right, time to go now ‚Äì have a great day, night, morning, afternoon, evening, milkshake smoothie or tropical fruit juice or whatever you‚Äôre having. Cheers!
Luke
