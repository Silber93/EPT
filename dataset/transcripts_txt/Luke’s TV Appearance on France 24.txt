If you were watching France24’s English channel yesterday evening, you might have heard a familiar voice during their debate at 19.10 CET.
The subject of the broadcast was the upcoming UK general election. The guests were journalists and specialists in European politics, and me too! They wanted another English voice on the programme, and perhaps someone who could provide a more light-hearted angle – who better than Luke from Luke’s English Podcast?
