Vocabulary
Here is the list of expressions which I use and explain in this podcast. It is all very useful for when you are travelling.
You’ll notice a lot of uses of Present Perfect Tense (have/has + past participle) in questions.
You’ll also notice the phrasal verbs – made of a verb + particle combination. They are very common, and there are lots in this podcast. There’s a transcript of the travelling conversation from this episode, just scroll down.

C: Definitely. It’s amazing. We’re loving Hoi-An. Ho Chi Min was cool too but a bit busy. So, where have you been so far?
L: Well, I flew in to Ho Chi Min and spent a couple of days there and just saw the sights. And then I flew up to Hanoi, because I’ve got a mate up there. And I spent New Year’s Eve there and I took a bus out to Halong Bay and I did that, stayed on a boat overnight.
C: Really? What was that like?
L: It’s pretty funny, really. The boat actually had mice on it.
C: Oh no.
L: And the engine was really loud at night, but it was funny. You know, there was good people on a boat. We had a really good laugh.
C: Cool. So, are you travelling down the coast now?
L: Yeah. That’s right. I fly out of Ho Chi Min City again in about a week. So I’m just going down the coast now by bus and train, visiting the main spots. Have you been to Hue?
C: No, not yet. We are travelling from south to north.
L: Oh right, ok. Hue is really nice. Go and see the imperial city. It’s really interesting.
C: What? Temples?
L: Yeah.
C: A bit templed out, to be honest.
L: A bit templed out. Lots of temples in Cambodia?
C: Yeah.
L: It is more temples, but they are pretty good. They’re worth visiting.
C: Ok.
L: So, after Hue, I took the train down here, beautiful views on the way. Really nice. I definitely recommend the train journey. Don’t eat the food though.
C: No?
L: No, it’s pretty rank.
C: Oh, ok. So are you just going to stick around in Hoi-An for a bit.
