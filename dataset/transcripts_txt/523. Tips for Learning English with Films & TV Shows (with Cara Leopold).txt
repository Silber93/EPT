Talking to a fellow English teacher about advice for using TV shows and films to learn English, both with and without subtitles.

Today on the podcast I’m talking to Cara Leopold who is an English teacher from the UK, living in France – like me.
Cara is an online teacher, who has her own podcast and other resources for learners of English on her website leo-listening.com.
One of the main things she focuses on is learning English through listening – especially using TV and films as a resource.
She’s got some tips to share on that subject – many of which come from her personal experiences of learning French, and so I’d like to talk to her about that,
But first I’d like to just get to know Cara a bit because we’ve never actually spoken before. So listeners, instead of hearing me talking to someone I already know (which is the way it normally goes on this podcast) you can now hear me having a conversation with someone I haven’t met before – so you can hear how that might happen in English.
