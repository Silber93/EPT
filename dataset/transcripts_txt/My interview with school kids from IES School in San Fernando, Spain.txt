Hi listeners, here is some bonus content for subscribers or visitors to teacherluke.co.uk.
This week I was contacted by teachers at a really great school in San Fernando in Spain. At the school they have a radio show which is hosted by children, and they do it all in English. The kids are 13-14 years old, and they’re very keen about studying English. Apparently, the teachers and children have been following my podcast and they wanted to interview me on their online radio show. I happily agreed to be interviewed. You can listen to the interview below.
We did the interview via Skype, with the children and teachers gathered together in their music room in the school, and me at home in my flat. There were about 25 kids in the room and they took turns to walk to the microphone and ask me their questions. It was very sweet to see them, listen to them speaking English and to hear the questions they had prepared.
IES San Fernando looks like a great school and the teachers, including Francisco Javier Rodríguez who first contacted me, look really cool. It was a fun experience for me so I thought I’d share it with you here. The interview is only 15 minutes long. You can listen and download using the media player below.
Thanks for reading!
