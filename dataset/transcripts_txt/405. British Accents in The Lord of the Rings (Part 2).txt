In this episode we continue to analyse the various British accents that you can hear in the film version of The Lord of the Rings. Let’s consider the accents of some of the main characters, such as Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Treebeard, Elrond, Boromir, Gandalf, Saruman, Legolas, Gimli and the orcs.

Frodo and Sam at the river (Frodo: English RP, Sam: English West Country)
Merry, Pippin & Treebeard (Merry: mild Manchester – Stockport, Pippin: Glasgow Scottish, Treebeard: old fashioned Scottish? RP with traces of Tolkien’s made-up elvish accent?)
Boromir at the Council of Elrond (Elrond: Heightened RP, Boromir: RP with traces of Yorkshire)
Sean Bean interview with Larry King (Sean Bean: Sheffield in Yorkshire, England / Larry King: Brooklyn NYC)
Gandalf and Saruman (Heightened RP / trained thespian actors at their best!)
Gimli & Legolas (Legolas: Heightened RP, Gimli: Welsh, which sounds Scottish at times)
Orcs (Cockney! Oi Oi!)
