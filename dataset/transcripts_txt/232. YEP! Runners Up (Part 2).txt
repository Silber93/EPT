Hi everyone. In this episode you can listen to conversations I had with YEP competition runners up Yannick, Aritz, Phil and Javier. They won their groups in the competition. In the next episode you’ll be able to listen to my conversation with the overall winner, Edgar from Mexico. [Download]

p.s. I’m a little bit frustrated by a technical issue in some of these interviews. There’s a slight delay on some of the Skype recordings – my interviewees responses are a bit late, and my responses come too quickly. It sounds like I’m rudely interrupting my interviewees sometimes. I hope it doesn’t bother you too much, or make me sound too rude!
