New website & new domain
You’re now reading this on the new website, which is teacherluke.co.uk. I thought for a long time about which domain name to choose and in the end I went for this one.
‘teacherluke’ is already well known as I have said it so many times on the podcast already. Also, it’s pretty simple. I chose .co.uk because it’s the official UK domain code, and British English is my thing isn’t it!
The website looks a little bit different. I think it’s a better use of the space, and I now have more control over the design.

I hope you like the site. Let me know what you think. If you spot any bugs, let me know! If the site looks a bit different and you miss the old version – You’ll get used to it in a while. I think it’s definitely better than it used to be. It’s all part of my effort to make Luke’s English Podcast & teacherluke.co.uk as user-friendly as possible.
Thanks for reading,
Luke
