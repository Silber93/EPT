Hi everyone,
Thanks very much for your comments here, and the emails I have been sent.
I have read your all your comments and I have taken them on board. I might not be able to make all the changes that everyone has suggested (you can’t please all the people all the time, etc etc) but I will continue to work on the podcast when I can, and keep it useful and enjoyable.
I have a few episodes to upload soon so you’ll be able to keep listening. In the meantime, thanks again for taking the time to give me some feedback.
Oh, and by the way “to stream something” means to listen or watch video or audio online rather than downloading it. For example, when you watch a YouTube video you are streaming it directly from the internet. When you use iTunes to listen to a podcast you’re (usually) not streaming it but downloading it and then listening to it later.
All the best,
Luke
