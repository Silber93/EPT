Here’s a video of Reggie Watts (Live at PopTech 2010)
It may be difficult to understand Reggie Watts. The main point of his comedy is that Reggie copies different speech patterns and switches between them very quickly. One moment he sounds like a posh English professor, then he sounds like a rapper from New York, then he sounds like an English cockney, and then he does an incredible song by creating loops on an effects unit and singing/rapping over the top.
