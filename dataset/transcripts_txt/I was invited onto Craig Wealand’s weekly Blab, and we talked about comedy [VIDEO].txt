Last week I joined Craig Wealand on his weekly Blab with some of his regular listeners. Every week Craig has a 1 hour Blab in which he invites podcast listeners, students and anyone else to chat with him about different subjects. It’s a very friendly atmosphere, anyone can get involved and it’s a good way for people to practice their English in a low-stress environment. This time the subject was comedy and Craig invited me into the conversation. If you like, you can check out the video of the conversation below. Cheers! Luke
